# InformationSystem

Work done in Sytems Information in 5th year of Masters.

## Work 1 - Baseband, Signal and Noise

This assignment is intended to study a digital broadcast in baseband. 

The transmitter generates a Dirac signal whenever it receives a logical '1' (simulated with a random generator to reproduce a true information source where we never know the information that will arrive). The information will pass through a filter, a simple transmission signal and a noise generator (to simulate real cases) until it reaches the receiver.

## Work 3 - Multisymbol Systems with Optimum Detection

This assignment aims at studying transmission systems based on optimum detection of multisymbol signals, using for this purpose the QAM signal.
